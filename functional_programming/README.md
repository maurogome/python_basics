## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a paradigm where the code is based binded through functions.It's known as declarative programming paradigm in which function definition are trees of expressions that each return a value.
For a start you can think in a function as a box which you can give some arguments, it makes an internal process and then it returns you a value. For example, imagine a function that calculate the area of a circle. You just have to call the function and give it the radius of any circle. The function will square the radius, multiply it by pi and return you the area.

"""
def circle_area(radius):
	area = pi * radius ** 2
	return area
"""
